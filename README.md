<br />1. QDMR graphs
<br />1.1. Evaluation of equivalance
<br />1.2. Unification
<br />2. Parsing of QDMR graphs
<br />2.1. From file, as given in the original paper
<br />3. Filtering of QDMR graphs
<br />3.1. Filtering by {set of consecutive operation, set of consecutive operations}
<br />4. Visualizer of graphs
<br />4.1. Using NetworkX
<br />
